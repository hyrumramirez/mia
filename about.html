                    <p>I am Mia, I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, I love California, from the valleys, mountains and forests to the Ocean. Summer is my favorite season, I get to surf, swim, skate, hike and go to all the beautiful places California has to offer. I also enjoy being with my family, I have a lot of cousins and every summer I get to hang out with them and we go camping. I live with my Mom and Dad, my moms name is Claudia and my Dads name is Hyrum, she is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and my Dad is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador">El Salvador</a>, I also have an older sister named Andrea, she is now serving a mission in South Carolina representing our <a href="http://lds.org">church.</a></p>
                    <p>I also love sports, I play Volleyball for my school (Bowditch Middle School) and for a Volleyball Club(Kamikaze Volleyball Club in Foster City. I like to compose songs and play them with my Ukulele. I also like to skate and I like to go out with my dad and practice in my Skateboard all over the Bay Area</p>
